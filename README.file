IMAGE COMPATIBILITY CHECKLIST
============================================================

This detector is designed for structured weekly schedule
templates similar to the samples used in this project.

Before uploading an image, make sure it meets the following
conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED (Must-Have)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Monday-Friday Columns Only
   - Exactly five weekday columns.
   - Saturday/Sunday columns may cause misalignment.
   - Extra columns can shift divider detection.

2) Left Time Lane Visible
   - The full vertical time scale must be visible.
   - The top visible time must match the selected "Start Time".
   - Dark tick marks must be visible.

3) 30-Minute Grid
   - Rows must align to consistent 30-minute increments.
   - Times like 9:55 AM are supported, but snapped to the
     nearest 30-minute block.
   - Off-grid schedules reduce accuracy.

4) White Background for Free Time
   - Free cells must be near white.
   - Dark mode schedules are not supported.
   - Heavy tinting or shading may cause misclassification.

5) Clear Grid Lines
   - Horizontal and vertical grid lines must be visible.
   - Extremely faint grids may break tick detection.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORTED WITH LIMITS
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Events That Start at Non-30-Minute Times
   Example:
     9:55 AM - 11:35 AM

   Behavior:
     - Snaps availability to 30-minute blocks.
     - Marks a block busy if any overlap exists.
     - This is intentional.

2) Large Full-Day Blocks
   - Works if purple color is consistent.
   - Heavy gradients or color shifts may fail detection.

3) Very Thin Blocks
   - Short events may be misread if probe bands
     hit grid lines instead of interior pixels.
   - Multi-band probing reduces but does not eliminate this.

------------------------------------------------------------
NOT SUPPORTED (Current Version)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Saturday / Sunday Columns
   - Architecture is calibrated for Monday-Friday only.
   - Extra columns can corrupt day region mapping.

2) Rotated / Cropped / Skewed Images
   - Image must be upright.
   - Entire grid must be visible.
   - Left time lane must be fully visible.

3) Non-White Free Cells
   - Gray, patterned, gradient, or dark backgrounds
     may break background calibration.

4) Different Color Schemes
   - Work blocks must be purple.
   - Significant hue variation may not be detected.

5) Completely Different Templates
   - This is not a general OCR engine.
   - It is a structured grid parser built for a
     specific schedule format.

------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN LIMITS
------------------------------------------------------------

- Snaps all availability to 30-minute blocks.
- Any overlap within a block marks it busy.
- Works best with clean exported images (PNG preferred).
- JPEG compression artifacts may slightly affect accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

This system is robust for:
  - Clean Monday-Friday schedule exports
  - Consistent 30-minute grid layouts
  - White backgrounds
  - Purple work blocks

It is not intended to parse arbitrary schedule designs.
